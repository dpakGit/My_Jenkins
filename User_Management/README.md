### Why create multiple users in Jenkins?

Creating multiple users in Jenkins allows you to control access to jobs, views, and other resources based on user roles or responsibilities. This ensures that users can only perform actions that are relevant to their job functions.

Example:

Suppose you have a Jenkins instance with multiple teams: Development, QA, and Operations. Each team has different responsibilities and should only have access to specific jobs and resources. By creating separate users for each team, you can control access and ensure that:

- Developers can only trigger and view development-related jobs.
- QA engineers can only trigger and view testing-related jobs.
- Operations team members can only trigger and view deployment-related jobs.

### Why not give full access or admin access to all users?

Giving full access or admin access to all users can pose security risks and lead to unintended changes or actions. Admin access allows users to modify Jenkins settings, install plugins, and access sensitive information.

Example:

Suppose you give full access to a user who is not familiar with Jenkins administration. If they accidentally delete a critical job or modify a configuration setting, it could cause significant disruptions to your CI/CD pipeline. By limiting access to specific users or roles, you can prevent such incidents and ensure that only authorized personnel can make changes.

Best Practice:

Create users with specific roles and permissions based on their job functions. This approach ensures that users can perform their tasks without having unnecessary access to sensitive areas of Jenkins.

In Jenkins, you can create users and assign roles using plugins like Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) or Matrix Authorization Strategy. This allows you to define fine-grained permissions and control access to resources based on user roles.

### Here's a breakdown of the specific things that an admin can do in Jenkins compared to a regular user:

Admin:

1. Configure Jenkins settings: Admins can modify Jenkins global configuration settings, such as security settings, plugin configurations, and system messages.
2. Manage plugins: Admins can install, update, and uninstall plugins, which can add new features or functionality to Jenkins.
3. Create and manage users: Admins can create new user accounts, modify existing user accounts, and assign roles or permissions to users.
4. Configure job security: Admins can configure job permissions, such as who can view, build, or configure jobs.
5. Manage nodes and slaves: Admins can add, remove, or configure build nodes and slaves, which are used to execute jobs.
6. View and manage system logs: Admins can view and manage system logs, which can help with troubleshooting and debugging.
7. Perform backups and restores: Admins can configure backups and restores of Jenkins configurations and job data.

Regular User:

1. View and build jobs: Regular users can view job configurations and build jobs, but may not be able to modify job configurations.
2. View job history: Regular users can view the build history and console output of jobs.
3. Trigger jobs: Regular users can trigger jobs to run, but may not be able to configure job settings.

Things Admins can do that regular users cannot:

- Modify Jenkins system settings
- Install or uninstall plugins
- Create or delete users
- Configure job permissions
- Add or remove nodes and slaves
- View and manage system logs
- Perform backups and restores

By limiting access to certain features and functions, Jenkins administrators can ensure that users can perform their tasks without compromising the security or stability of the Jenkins instance.


### In Jenkins, a Security Realm is a mechanism that authenticates users and verifies their identities. Think of it like a login system.

<br><br>

Jenkins' own user database is a type of Security Realm that stores user information and credentials within Jenkins itself. When you choose this option, Jenkins uses its own internal database to manage user accounts, authentication, and authorization.

Here's what it means:

1. User accounts are stored in Jenkins: When you create a user account, it's stored in Jenkins' internal database.
2. Jenkins handles authentication: When a user logs in, Jenkins verifies their credentials against its internal database.
3. No external dependencies: You don't need to set up an external authentication system, like LDAP or Active Directory.

Using Jenkins' own user database is a simple and straightforward way to manage user access, especially for small teams or proof-of-concepts. However, for larger organizations, you might want to consider integrating with an external authentication system for more advanced features and centralized management.


### In Jenkins, Authorization refers to the process of determining what actions a user can perform after they've been authenticated (logged in).

<img width="1920" height="1080" alt="Screenshot (460)" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6925fb86-b0da-419b-b6cd-08f729961032" />

<br><br>
Logged-in users can do anything is a type of Authorization strategy in Jenkins. When you choose this option, Jenkins grants all logged-in users full access to the system, allowing them to perform any action.

Here's what it means:

1. No restrictions: Once a user is logged in, they have unrestricted access to Jenkins.
2. Full control: Users can view, configure, and manage jobs, nodes, plugins, and other settings.
3. No permission checks: Jenkins doesn't perform any additional permission checks beyond authentication.

This authorization strategy is not recommended for production environments, as it can pose security risks. With this setting, any user who can log in can potentially:

- Modify or delete jobs and configurations
- Install or uninstall plugins
- View sensitive information
- Make changes to the Jenkins system configuration

In general, it's better to use a more restrictive authorization strategy, such as Matrix-based security or Role-Based Access Control, to ensure that users only have the necessary permissions to perform their tasks.

### When a user has the "Logged-in users can do anything" authorization strategy, they essentially have the same permissions and privileges as an admin user.

In this setup, Jenkins doesn't distinguish between different user roles or permissions. Once a user is logged in, they have full access to the system, which is equivalent to having admin-level privileges.

So, in practice, "Logged-in users can do anything" is similar to giving all logged-in users admin rights, which can be a security risk if not managed carefully.

It's worth noting that this strategy doesn't necessarily mean the user has the "admin" role explicitly assigned to them, but rather that they have the same level of access and control as an admin user.

### Let's break down when to use Matrix-based security and Project-based Matrix Authorization Strategy in Jenkins:

**Matrix-based Security:**

Matrix-based security is a global authorization strategy in Jenkins that allows you to define a matrix of users and groups versus permissions. You can grant specific permissions to users or groups across the entire Jenkins instance.

----------------------------------------
When I said "entire Jenkins instance," I meant the whole Jenkins system, including:

1. All jobs (projects) configured in Jenkins
2. All nodes (slaves) connected to Jenkins
3. All system settings and configurations
4. All plugins and their configurations

In other words, when you set up Matrix-based security, you're defining permissions that apply to the entire Jenkins system, rather than just a specific job or project.

This means that the permissions you grant to users or groups will be applicable across all jobs, nodes, and system settings, unless you've set up more specific permissions at a lower level (e.g., job-specific permissions).

-----------------------------------------

When to use:

Use Matrix-based security when you want to manage permissions globally, across multiple jobs and projects. This strategy is useful when you have a small to medium-sized Jenkins instance with a limited number of jobs and users.

Example:

Suppose you have a Jenkins instance with three teams: Development, QA, and Operations. You want to grant the following permissions:

- Developers can create and configure jobs, but not manage nodes.
- QA engineers can trigger jobs, but not configure them.
- Operations team members can manage nodes and view job configurations.

You can create a matrix with the following permissions:

| User/Group | Overall | Job | Node |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Developers | Configure | Create, Configure | - |
| QA | - | Trigger | - |
| Operations | - | View | Configure |

**Project-based Matrix Authorization Strategy:**

Project-based Matrix Authorization Strategy is a job-specific authorization strategy that allows you to define permissions for each job individually. You can grant specific permissions to users or groups for a particular job.

When to use:

Use Project-based Matrix Authorization Strategy when you want to manage permissions at the job level, rather than globally. This strategy is useful when you have a large Jenkins instance with many jobs and teams, and you want to delegate permission management to job owners or administrators.

Example:

Suppose you have a job called "Deploy to Production" that should only be triggered by the Operations team. You want to grant the following permissions:

- Operations team members can trigger and configure the job.
- Developers can view the job configuration, but not trigger or modify it.

You can configure the Project-based Matrix Authorization Strategy for the "Deploy to Production" job as follows:

| User/Group | Job |
| --- | --- |
| Operations | Configure, Trigger |
| Developers | View |

In this example, the Operations team has full control over the job, while developers can only view the job configuration.

### 

### Let's break down the difference between assigning Read permission for a job and Read permission for Overall in the Authorization Matrix-based security:

Read permission for a Job:

- Grants the user permission to view the job's configuration and build history.
- Allows the user to see the job's details, such as its description, parameters, and build logs.
- Does not grant permission to build, configure, or modify the job in any way.

Read permission for Overall:

- Grants the user permission to view the overall Jenkins instance, including:
    - Job names and descriptions (but not necessarily the job's configuration or build history)
    - Node information (e.g., node names, labels, and status)
    - System configuration (e.g., global security settings, plugin configurations)
- Does not grant permission to view specific job configurations or build history unless explicitly granted.

In summary:

- Read permission for a Job allows users to view the job's details and build history.
- Read permission for Overall allows users to view the overall Jenkins instance, including job names and descriptions, node information, and system configuration.

To illustrate the difference:

- If you grant a user Read permission for a Job, they can view the job's configuration and build history for that specific job.
- If you grant a user Read permission for Overall, they can see the job's name and description in the Jenkins dashboard, but may not be able to view the job's configuration or build history unless they have explicit Read permission for that job.

Does that clarify the difference?

### Let's break down the different columns in the Authorization Matrix-based security:

1. Overall:
    - Refers to global permissions that apply to the entire Jenkins instance.
    - Includes permissions like Administer (full control), Read (view system configuration), etc.

2. Agent:
    - Refers to permissions related to managing Jenkins agents (nodes or slaves).
    - Includes permissions like Configure (configure agents), Delete (delete agents), Connect (connect to agents), etc.

3. Job:
    - Refers to permissions related to managing Jenkins jobs.
    - Includes permissions like Read (view job configuration), Build (trigger builds), Configure (configure job settings), Create (create new jobs), Delete (delete jobs), etc.

4. Run:
    - Refers to permissions related to managing job builds (runs).
    - Includes permissions like Read (view build details), Cancel (cancel running builds), Delete (delete build records), etc.

5. View:
    - Refers to permissions related to managing Jenkins views.
    - Includes permissions like Read (view existing views), Create (create new views), Configure (configure views), Delete (delete views), etc.

6. SCM:
    - Refers to permissions related to Source Control Management (SCM) systems.
    - Includes permissions like Tag (create tags in SCM), etc.

7. Administer:
    - Typically a global permission that grants full control over Jenkins.
    - Includes all other permissions.

Each column represents a specific area of Jenkins where permissions can be granted or denied. By setting permissions in these columns, you can control what actions users or groups can perform in Jenkins.

### In Matrix-based security in Jenkins, Overall Read permission for a user means:

The user can view the Jenkins system configuration, including:

1. System settings
2. Global configuration
3. Plugin configurations
4. Node information
5. Job names and descriptions (but not necessarily the job's configuration or build history)

What they can't do:

1. Modify any configuration
2. Build, configure, or delete jobs
3. Manage nodes or slaves
4. Install or uninstall plugins

In essence, Overall Read permission provides a read-only view of the Jenkins system's configuration and status, allowing users to get an overview of the system without being able to make any changes.

This permission is useful for users who need to:

1. Monitor the Jenkins system
2. Get an overview of the system's configuration
3. View system information without being able to modify it

Does that clarify the meaning of Overall Read permission?

### To summarize :

1. Overall Read permission:
    - Grants access to the Jenkins instance itself.
    - Allows users to view the Jenkins dashboard, system configuration, and node information.
    - Does not grant access to job configurations or build history.
2. Job Read permission:
    - Grants access to specific jobs.
    - Allows users to view job configurations, build history, and other job-related information.

So, if you want users to:

- View the Jenkins instance and its configuration, grant Overall Read.
- View specific jobs and their configurations, grant Job Read.

You're absolutely right!
