Step 2: Install the Matrix Authorization Strategy plugin

1. Go to the Jenkins dashboard and click on Manage Jenkins.
2. Click on Manage Plugins.
3. Search for Matrix Authorization Strategy in the plugin repository.
4. Install the plugin and restart Jenkins if prompted.

Step 3: Configure Matrix Authorization Strategy

1. Go to the Jenkins dashboard and click on Manage Jenkins.
2. Click on Configure Global Security/Security.
3. Scroll down to the Authorization section.
4. Select Matrix-based security as the authorization strategy.

Step 4: Add a user to the Matrix

1. In the Matrix Authorization Strategy section, click on Add user or group.
2. Enter the existing username or group name already created,in the User/group to add field.
3. Click Add.

Step 4: Configure permissions for the user

1. Once the user is added to the matrix, you can configure their permissions by checking the boxes next to the specific permissions you want to grant.
2. You can grant permissions for various aspects of Jenkins, such as:
    - Overall (e.g., administer, read)
    - Job (e.g., build, configure, delete)
    - Agent (e.g., configure, create, delete)
    - View (e.g., create, delete, read)
3. Select the permissions you want to grant to the user.

Step 5: Save changes

1. Once you've configured the user's permissions, click Save to save the changes.

The user should now have the specified permissions and be able to access Jenkins accordingly.


**Note: Since Matrix-based security grants global permissions, a user with all job permissions can perform any action on existing jobs, but to create new jobs, they would also need the 'Job -> Create' permission.**

### When it says "permissions are indeed granted globally" in the context of Matrix-based security in Jenkins, it means that the permissions are applied across the entire Jenkins instance, rather than being specific to a particular job or folder.

In other words, when you grant a permission to a user or group in the Matrix-based security settings, it applies to all jobs, views, and other objects within Jenkins, unless a more specific permission is set elsewhere (e.g., at the job level).

This is in contrast to some other authorization systems that might allow permissions to be set on a per-job or per-folder basis, where the permissions are more granular and specific to a particular object.

So, in the context of Matrix-based security, "globally" refers to the fact that the permissions are applied at the top-level of the Jenkins instance, affecting all objects within it.


### In Matrix-based security, the "Discover" option under Job permissions allows users to see the existence of jobs in Jenkins, without granting them access to the job's configuration or contents.

When a user has the "Discover" permission, they can:

- See the job names in the Jenkins dashboard
- View the job's existence in the job list

However, they will not be able to:

- View the job's configuration
- Build or run the job
- View the job's workspace or artifacts

The "Discover" permission is useful in scenarios where you want to:

- Allow users to browse the list of jobs without granting them access to sensitive information
- Provide visibility into the job structure and organization
- Enable users to find and request access to specific jobs

Use cases for the "Discover" permission include:

- Large-scale Jenkins deployments with many jobs, where users need to navigate and find specific jobs
- Environments where job names are descriptive and meaningful, and users need to identify jobs without accessing their contents
- Situations where users need to request access to specific jobs, and the "Discover" permission helps them find the job they need.

### If you grant the "Job -> Read" permission, it typically includes the ability to discover jobs. The "Read" permission usually allows users to view job details, which implies that they can also see the job's existence and discover it in the list of jobs.

In other words, granting "Job -> Read" permission would likely include the "Discover" capability, making it unnecessary to grant "Discover" separately.

So, in most cases, if you grant "Job -> Read" permission, users will be able to:

- Discover jobs (see job names in the list)
- View job details (configuration, etc.)

Keep in mind that specific plugin configurations or custom permission setups might affect this behavior, but in general, "Job -> Read" permission includes the "Discover" capability.


### In Matrix-based security in Jenkins, "Authenticated Users" refers to a special group that includes all users who have successfully logged in to Jenkins.

When you grant permissions to "Authenticated Users", you're essentially granting those permissions to every user who has authenticated with Jenkins, regardless of their individual identity or group membership.

Use cases for granting permissions to "Authenticated Users" include:

- Providing a baseline level of access to all users who have authenticated with Jenkins
- Allowing users to view certain information or perform certain actions without requiring explicit permission for each individual user or group
- Simplifying permission management by reducing the number of groups or users that need to be managed

For example, you might grant "Authenticated Users" the permission to:

- View certain jobs or views
- Build certain jobs
- View system information or metrics

By granting permissions to "Authenticated Users", you can establish a common set of privileges that apply to all authenticated users, while still maintaining more restrictive permissions for sensitive areas of Jenkins.

It's worth noting that "Authenticated Users" is a special group that is automatically populated with all authenticated users, so you don't need to manage membership in this group explicitly.

*In Matrix-based security in Jenkins, granting permissions to the 'Authenticated Users' matrix and leaving the permission matrices for individual users blank will effectively give those permissions to all authenticated users. This is a common way to set a baseline permission level for all users. It's used when you want all authenticated users to have the same permissions by default.*

Example:
If you grant "Job Read" and "View Read" permissions to "authenticated users" in the global security matrix, every user who logs into Jenkins will be able to see all jobs and views. However, they will not be able to build jobs, configure projects, or manage credentials unless explicitly granted those permissions either individually or through group membership.

Jenkins Matrix-based Security, specifically the "authenticated users" entry, refers to the permissions granted to any user who has successfully logged into Jenkins. This differs from "anonymous" users, who are unauthenticated users accessing the Jenkins environment.
Key aspects of "authenticated users" in Matrix-based Security:
Global Permissions: When using the global Matrix-based Security (not project-based), the permissions granted to "authenticated users" apply to all authenticated users across the entire Jenkins instance.
Default Permissions: By default, the "authenticated" entry typically has no permissions configured. This means that simply being authenticated does not automatically grant access to any specific actions or resources within Jenkins.
Granular Control: Administrators can use the "authenticated" entry to grant a baseline level of access to all authenticated users. For example, you might grant "Overall Read" permission to all authenticated users, allowing them to view jobs and views but not modify them.
Combination with Individual Users/Groups: Permissions granted to "authenticated users" are additive with permissions granted to specific individual users or groups. If a user is part of a group that has more specific permissions, those permissions will also apply.
Security Best Practices: It is generally recommended to limit the permissions granted to "authenticated users" to a minimum, such as read-only access, and then grant more specific permissions to individual users or groups based on their roles and responsibilities. This helps in maintaining a secure Jenkins environment.

#### Note: 

By adding "all the jobs in a Jenkins instance", you've made the description even more accurate and clear.

Yes, that's a great way to phrase it:

"Matrix-based authorization refers to a global authorization strategy in Jenkins where you can define a matrix of permissions for different roles or users across all the jobs in a Jenkins instance. This allows you to manage permissions in a centralized way, specifying what actions a particular role or user can perform on these jobs."

This clearly conveys that matrix-based authorization is a global strategy that applies to all jobs in the Jenkins instance, and that it allows for centralized management of permissions.

Well done!
