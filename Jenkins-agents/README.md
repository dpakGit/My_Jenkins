In Jenkins, the terms "agent" and "slave" (or "node") are often used interchangeably, but there is a subtle distinction.

Slave Node: In older versions of Jenkins (before 2.0), a slave node referred to a machine that was connected to a master node and executed tasks assigned to it. The master node would distribute tasks to the slave nodes, which would then execute the tasks.

Agent: In modern Jenkins (2.0 and later), the term "agent" is used instead of "slave". An agent is a machine that connects to the Jenkins master and executes tasks. Agents can be:

1. Permanent agents: These are machines that are always connected to the Jenkins master and are available to execute tasks.
2. Cloud agents: These are machines that are dynamically provisioned and deprovisioned by Jenkins as needed.
3. Docker agents: These are containers that run on a Docker host and execute tasks.

In essence, an agent is a more modern and flexible concept than a slave node. While the terms are often used interchangeably, "agent" is the preferred term in modern Jenkins documentation and configurations.

So, to answer your question, a Jenkins agent and a slave node are essentially the same thing, but "agent" is the more contemporary and accurate term.
