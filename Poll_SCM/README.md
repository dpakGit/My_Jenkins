To automatically trigger the Jenkins job that clones the Git repository, you can use various methods. Here are a few:

Method 1: Using Git Webhook

If you're using GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket, you can configure a webhook to trigger the Jenkins job whenever code is pushed to the repository.

1. Go to your Git repository settings and find the webhook section.
2. Add a new webhook with the Jenkins job URL, typically in the format http://your-jenkins-server:8080/job/your-job-name/build?token=your-token.
3. Configure the webhook to trigger on push events.

Method 2: Using Jenkins SCM Polling

You can configure Jenkins to poll the Git repository at regular intervals to check for changes.

1. Go to the Jenkins job configuration page.
2. In the "Source Code Management" section, select "Git" and configure the repository URL and credentials.
3. In the "Build Triggers" section, select "Poll SCM" and specify the schedule (e.g., */5 * * * * to poll every 5 minutes).

Method 3: Using Jenkins Git Plugin with Webhook

If you're using the Jenkins Git plugin, you can configure it to trigger the job when a push event is received from the Git repository.

1. Go to the Jenkins job configuration page.
2. In the "Build Triggers" section, select "GitHub hook trigger for GITScm polling" (or the equivalent for your Git provider).

Token-based Triggering

To trigger the job using a token, you can add a token to the job configuration and then use the token in the webhook URL.

1. Go to the Jenkins job configuration page.
2. In the "Build Triggers" section, select "Trigger builds remotely (e.g., from scripts)" and specify a token.
3. Use the token in the webhook URL: http://your-jenkins-server:8080/job/your-job-name/build?token=your-token.

By using one of these methods, you can automatically trigger the Jenkins job that clones the Git repository, which will then trigger the subsequent build and test jobs.


Here's the step-by-step process to configure Jenkins SCM polling:

Step 1: Go to the Jenkins Job Configuration Page

1. Log in to your Jenkins server.
2. Click on the job name that you want to configure (e.g., "clone").
3. Click on the "Configure" button on the left-hand side menu.

Step 2: Configure Source Code Management

1. Scroll down to the "Source Code Management" section.
2. Select "Git" as the source code management system.
3. Enter the repository URL:
    - HTTPS URL (e.g., https://github.com/username/repository.git)
    - SSH URL (e.g., git@github.com:username/repository.git)
4. Specify the credentials:
    - If you have already added credentials in Jenkins, select them from the dropdown menu.
    - If not, click on "Add" and enter your Git repository credentials (username and password or SSH private key).
5. Specify the branch to build (e.g., */main or */master).

Step 3: Configure Build Triggers

1. Scroll down to the "Build Triggers" section.
2. Select "Poll SCM".
3. Specify the schedule:
    - Enter */5 * * * * to poll every 5 minutes.
    - You can use the following format to specify the schedule:
        - */X * * * * : poll every X minutes
        - X * * * * : poll at X minute past every hour
        - X Y * * * : poll at X minute past Y hour every day

Step 4: Save the Configuration

1. Click on the "Save" button at the bottom of the page to save the configuration.

How it Works

Jenkins will now poll the Git repository at the specified interval (every 5 minutes in this example). If changes are detected, Jenkins will trigger the job to build and execute the subsequent jobs (build and test) in the pipeline.

Note that SCM polling can be resource-intensive and may not be suitable for large repositories or frequent polling intervals. In such cases, consider using webhooks or other trigger mechanisms.


When Jenkins "polls" the Git repository, it means that Jenkins periodically checks the repository for changes. Here's what happens during polling:

1. Jenkins sends a request: Jenkins sends a request to the Git repository to check for updates.
2. Git repository responds: The Git repository responds with information about the latest commits, branches, or tags.
3. Jenkins compares: Jenkins compares the received information with the previous state of the repository (cached in Jenkins).
4. Changes detected: If Jenkins detects changes (e.g., new commits, updated branches), it triggers the job to build and execute.

Polling is a pull-based approach, where Jenkins initiates the request to the Git repository to check for changes. This is in contrast to webhooks, which are push-based, where the Git repository sends a notification to Jenkins when changes occur.

Polling frequency

The polling frequency determines how often Jenkins checks the repository for changes. A shorter polling interval (e.g., every 1 minute) means Jenkins will detect changes more quickly, but it may also increase the load on the Jenkins server and the Git repository.

When to use polling

Polling is suitable for:

- Small to medium-sized repositories with infrequent changes.
- Situations where webhooks are not feasible or supported.
- Development environments where changes are not extremely frequent.

However, for large repositories or high-frequency change environments, webhooks or other trigger mechanisms might be more efficient.
