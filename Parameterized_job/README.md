### Creating and running a parameterized Jenkins job involves the following steps:
Select or Create a Jenkins Job:
Choose an existing Jenkins job (e.g., a Freestyle project or Pipeline).
Alternatively, create a new job by navigating to "New Item" and selecting the desired project type.
Configure the Job:
Navigate to the job's configuration page. For a Freestyle project, this is typically done by clicking "Configure" on the job's main page.
Enable Parameterized Builds:
In the "General" section of the job configuration, locate and check the âœ…"This project is parameterized" checkbox.
Add Parameters:
Click the "Add Parameter" dropdown button that appears after enabling parameterized builds.
Select the desired parameter type (e.g., String Parameter, Boolean Parameter, Choice Parameter, Password Parameter, File Parameter, etc.).
Configure each parameter by providing a Name, an optional Default Value, and a Description.
Use Parameters in Build Steps:
In the "Build" section of your job configuration, integrate the defined parameters into your build steps. Parameters are typically accessed as environment variables using the syntax ${PARAMETER_NAME} within shell commands, scripts, or other build tools.
Save the Job Configuration:
Apply and save the changes to your Jenkins job configuration.
Build with Parameters:
On the job's main page, you will now see a "Build with Parameters" link (instead of just "Build Now").
Click this link to trigger a build.
Provide Parameter Values:
A form will appear, displaying the defined parameters. Enter the desired values for each parameter for this specific build.
Trigger the Build:
Click the "Build" button to start the Jenkins job with the provided parameter values.
Monitor and Review:
Monitor the job execution and review the console output to ensure the parameters were correctly passed and used within the build process.


In the context of Jenkins, BRANCH is the name given to a parameter in a parameterized build.

When you create a parameterized build in Jenkins, you can define various types of parameters, such as string parameters, boolean parameters, choice parameters, etc. In this case, BRANCH is the name of a string parameter.

By defining a parameter named BRANCH, you can pass the branch name as a variable to your Jenkins job. This allows you to:

1. Specify the branch to build or deploy when triggering the job manually.
2. Use the BRANCH variable in your Jenkinsfile or build scripts to perform branch-specific actions.

For example, in your Jenkinsfile, you might reference the BRANCH parameter like this:

```
pipeline {
    parameters {
        string(name: 'BRANCH', defaultValue: 'main', description: 'Branch to build')
    }
    stages {
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                git branch: "${BRANCH}", credentialsId: 'your-credentials', url: 'https://github.com/your-repo.git'
                // Build steps here
            }
        }
    }
}
``
In this example, the BRANCH parameter determines which branch to check out from the Git repository during the build process.

Yes, BRANCH is a variable in the context of Jenkins parameterized builds.

When you define a parameter named BRANCH in Jenkins, you can access its value using the syntax ${BRANCH} in your Jenkinsfile or build scripts.

In Jenkins, parameters are essentially environment variables that are set before the build starts. By using the ${BRANCH} syntax, you can reference the value of the BRANCH parameter in your scripts.

For example, if you set the BRANCH parameter to feature/new-feature, then ${BRANCH} would evaluate to feature/new-feature.

Here's a simpler version:

"In Jenkins, parameters are like variables that you can use in your build scripts. You can access their values using ${BRANCH}."

Or even:

"Think of Jenkins parameters like placeholders that hold values. You can use ${BRANCH} to use the value in your scripts."
